# Assembly OS Development

This project aims to develop an operating system (OS) using assembly language. The OS will provide low-level control over hardware and implement essential functionalities such as process management, memory management, device drivers, and file systems. The development will primarily focus on a specific target platform, which is [insert target platform here, e.g., x86 architecture].

## Getting Started

To get started with OS development, follow the steps below:

1. **Understanding Computer Architecture**: Familiarize yourself with the architecture of the target platform, including CPU, memory organization, I/O system, and interrupt handling mechanisms. This knowledge is essential for writing assembly code specific to the target platform.

2. **Choose an Assembly Language**: Select an assembly language compatible with the target platform's architecture. Common options include x86 assembly for Intel-compatible processors, ARM assembly for ARM-based processors, or MIPS assembly for MIPS-based processors.

3. **Bootstrapping**: Create a bootloader responsible for loading the OS into memory and transferring control to the kernel. The bootloader code is typically written in assembly and resides in the first sector of a bootable storage medium (e.g., the Master Boot Record or MBR).

4. **Kernel Development**: Develop the OS kernel, which forms the core of the operating system. The kernel should handle process management, memory management, and system calls. Write the kernel code in assembly language, utilizing the appropriate instructions for the target architecture.

5. **Hardware Interaction**: Interact with hardware devices by writing device drivers in assembly. Device drivers enable the OS to communicate with peripherals such as disks, keyboards, displays, and network adapters. Understand the hardware's I/O ports, memory-mapped registers, and interrupt handling mechanisms for efficient device driver development.

6. **Memory Management**: Implement memory management techniques such as page tables or segmentation to control memory allocation, deallocation, and protection. Assembly language provides fine-grained control over memory operations, allowing efficient management of memory resources.

7. **File System**: Design and implement a file system to store and manage files on storage devices. This involves creating data structures, handling file operations, and managing disk I/O.

8. **User Interface**: Depending on the OS goals, develop a user interface (UI) to interact with the system. This could range from a command-line interface (CLI) to a graphical user interface (GUI). GUI development may require additional libraries or frameworks.

9. **Testing and Debugging**: Regularly test the OS to ensure its correct functioning. Implement debugging features and tools to help identify and fix issues. Emulators and virtual machines can be useful for testing without risking the stability of physical hardware.

10. **Iterative Development**: OS development is an iterative process. Start with a minimal set of features and gradually add functionality. Test and refine your code as you progress, keeping in mind the constraints and limitations of working at the assembly language level.

- [MIPS Architecture](https://www.mips.com/products/architectures/): MIPS Technologies' website provides resources and documentation related to the MIPS architecture.

## Documentation

Throughout the development process, it is crucial to document your code and design decisions. Maintaining clear and concise documentation helps you understand and maintain the OS over time. Here are some documentation practices to consider:

1. **Code Comments**: Write detailed comments explaining the purpose, functionality, and limitations of each code section, function, or module. Commenting helps other developers understand your code and assists you in revisiting and modifying it later.

2. **Design Documentation**: Document the high-level design of your OS, including the system architecture, component interactions, and data structures. Describe the responsibilities of different modules and how they interact with each other. This documentation will serve as a reference for understanding the overall structure of your OS.

3. **API Documentation**: If your OS exposes APIs for application developers or device driver developers, document these interfaces clearly. Provide information about the parameters, return values, and usage guidelines. Good API documentation helps others utilize and extend your OS effectively.

4. **Change Log**: Maintain a change log that records significant changes made to the OS. Include information about bug fixes, feature additions, and modifications to the codebase. The change log helps you track the evolution of your OS and facilitates collaboration with other contributors.

5. **Tutorials and Guides**: Consider creating tutorials or guides to assist others in understanding and using your OS. These resources can cover topics such as setting up the development environment, building and running the OS, and developing applications or device drivers for your OS.

## Conclusion

Developing an operating system using assembly language is a challenging but rewarding endeavor. By understanding computer architecture, writing efficient assembly code, and implementing essential OS functionalities, you can create a custom OS tailored to your target platform. Remember to iterate, test, and document your code throughout the development process. Contributions from the open-source community can also greatly enhance the capabilities and usability of your OS. Enjoy the journey of OS development and continue expanding your knowledge in this fascinating field.
